# Task
# Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

# Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.


N = int(input())

for i in range(0, N):

    string = input()

    for j in range(0, len(string)):
        if j % 2 == 0:
            print(string[j], end='')

    print(" ", end='')

    for j in range(0, len(string)):
        if j % 2 != 0:
            print(string[j], end='')

    print("")
